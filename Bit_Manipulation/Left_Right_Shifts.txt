Binary Left Shift and Binary Right Shift

## Binary Left Shift :

    All the 0,1 gets shifted to the left and the empty space gets filled with 0.
    N = N << 1;
    This is the example of left shift by 1 time.
    Left shift by (i) times is nothing but equal to the multiplying the number by 2 
        i times.
    Means, N = N << 2 is equal to the N = N * (2^i)

## Binary Right Shift

    In the all 0,1 are shifted to right and empty space is filled with 0
    All right digits will get discarded.
    N = N >> 2 . It is similar to the N = N / (2^i)
